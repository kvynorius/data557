#### Mondays
Monday is our in-person day during which time we will work through a real-world data science problem together. Your attendance is expected.
#### Wednesdays
Lectures will be posted on Wednesday morning and you are expected to have completed each weeks lectures prior to the following in-person class.

You can attend the online lectures [here](http://data557.surge.sh/#lectures).
#### Lecture notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks for each lecture can be found [here](notebooks).
