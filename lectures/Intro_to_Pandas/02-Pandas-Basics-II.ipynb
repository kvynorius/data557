    "To index the dataframe by label, we use the `.loc[]` attribute. Note that there are square brackets `[]` at the end of the attribute. This makes sense since we always use square brackets to index an array. The syntax is as follows, we call `.loc[row label(s), column label(s)]`. What we are actually doing is selecting by boolean conditional here. In other words, we tell pandas to return the dataframe where certain conditions evaluate to \"true\". Let's see an example below with the Nobel prize data.\n",
